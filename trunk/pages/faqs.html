	<dt>Can I use Espresso UI with Prototype?</dt>
	<dd>No. Mootools and Prototype are not compatible, if you need a Prototype UI, then you've come to the wrong place. Currently, I have no plans to make this script Prototype, for I prefer MooTools much more.</dd>

	<dt>How do I get Espresso UI to work with an older version of Mootools?</dt>
	<dd>Espresso UI uses Mootools 1.2. There is no back coding for me, it would be a waste to step backwards and recode in an old version of MooTools. Try getting the MooTools 1.2 with Previous Version Support.</dd>
